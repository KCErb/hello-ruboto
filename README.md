# Hello Ruboto!

This is the source code for a website called [Hello Ruboto](http://kcerb.github.io/hello-ruboto/).

Hello Ruboto is a little bundle of [Ruboto](http://ruboto.org/) tutorials written by me to
bridge the gap between writing a pure-Ruby Android App, and reading pure Java
documentation.

# Contributing

I would love to have contributions from anyone at all. I don't know anything about
Java, I'm a pretty new Rubyist, and I'm not a professional writer. The only qualification
I have to do a project like this is my enthusiasm for the topic!

So I welcome constructive criticism, Pull Requests, Issues, or anything else that anyone
has to offer on the project.
