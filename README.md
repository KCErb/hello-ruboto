# Hello Ruboto!

This is a tutorial for folks that know a bit about ruby and nothing about writing code for Android devices.
It walks step by step through the tutorials found at http://developer.android.com/training/index.html. Except
that it changes all of that Java XML stuff in favor of Ruboto.

I'm writing this because I *am* someone who knows a bit (not a lot) about ruby and am brand new to Android 
development. 

So go ahead and dig into these lessons!
