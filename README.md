# Hello Ruboto!

This is a tutorial for folks that know a bit about ruby and nothing about writing code for Android devices.

It walks step by step through the tutorials found at http://developer.android.com/training/index.html. And
attempts to exactly copy their content with one major difference **These instructions are for Ruboto**! Yay

That means we won't be writing any thing but sweet sweet Ruby.
