Don't worry, we'll get into all kinds of details very soon. But right now
let's just fire up a demo and make sure you can see something functioning on your
device before we go on.

## Using gen app to get started

1. Go to a new clean directory where you want to put some projects.

2. In the terminal run `ruboto gen app --package org.ruboto.example.quick_start`.

3. Go into the directory that ruboto just created `cd quick_start`.

4. Build it by running `rake` (this generates the apk at `bin/QuickStart-debug.apk`).
