OK so you have a working environment, you have an app, and you have either a device or a
virtual device. Now we just want to put the app onto the device and see it in action.

## Installing the app

When your device is running/connected you can type `rake install start` into the command line
and the demo app should spring to life.

If you haven't already downloaded the ruboto core (and if you're new to this,
then you probably haven't), then you will be prompted to get it from
the app store. This app has the stuff Ruboto needs to do its magic.

## Done

If you see the following on your screen then all is well and you are ready to start your training!

If not, don't sweat it! Please email me so that I can make these instructions better. The startup
phase is the hardest part of this whole process and I want to make it awesome, so please contact me!
