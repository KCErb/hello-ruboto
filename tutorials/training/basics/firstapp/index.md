# Building Your First App

Welcome to app development with Ruboto! In order to get started we need to get your
development environment setup and that may be tricky if you're very new to programming.

Here are some great resources for getting your environment set up and ship-shape:

- From [the Ruboto Wiki](https://github.com/ruboto/ruboto/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Ruboto-Development-Environment)
- From [Ruby Learning](http://rubylearning.com/blog/ruboto-quick-start/)

If you are still struggling to get up and running feel free to let me know. If there is interest I will
attempt to write up my experience (a piece of that experience is [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21273696/rake-aborted-no-such-file-or-directory-ant-version/21324017#21324017))

When you're done with this you should have some basic components.

1. A Ruby Implementation
2. Ruboto
3. Android Development Environment
4. Either an AVD or a real device running Android OS

Before we go on to the next step I want to make a point: get a device! I originally wanted to do
all of my development from an emulator (couldn't afford the devices on the market at the time) and
quickly found out how difficult and frustrating that can be. Plus with a device you really get a feel
for what the user will experience.

Nowadays you can get a basic device running Android OS for under/around $100 bucks. That's a lot
of money for a lot of us, but it's worth saving up for if you really want to get the hang of this!

OK, enough preaching.
