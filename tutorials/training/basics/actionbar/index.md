# Adding the Action Bar

The action bar is the place at the top of your app where you will
put settings and other tools.

{% include image.html width='300px' src='action_bar.png' page=page %}


In this lesson we'll learn how to put an action bar on our app and do some basic things with it. This lesson will also start introducing you to the Android documentation.

On that note, before you go on, feel free to read through the API guide on the [action bar](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html)!
