# It's the little things that count

The next set of lessons are dedicated to teaching about those little tips, tricks and tools
that make programming an app for Android more fun to do. If you know of any that I haven't covered
here please let me know. I'd like to see this list grow!

# If you build it, they will come

Right now this list of helpers is kinda sparse and non of them are built by the
Ruboto community. If you see an opportunity to make a gem that makes Ruboto better,
build it! The more community members participate in making Ruboto awesome, the better
it will be and the larger the community will become.
