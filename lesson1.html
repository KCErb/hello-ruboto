<h1>Building a Simple User Interface</h1>

<p>In this lesson you&#39;ll create a simple user interface with a text field
and a button. In the following lesson, you&#39;ll respond when the button
is pressed by sending the content of the text field to another activity.</p>

<h2>Create a Linear Layout</h2>

<p>Open the <code>new_demo_activity.rb</code> file from the <code>src/</code> directory. The template
that Ruboto beautifully generates for you is neat, but we&#39;re going to throw it
all away and start from scratch. So go ahead and replace the contents of the file
with the following:</p>

[sourcecode language="ruby"]require &#39;ruboto/widget&#39;

class NewDemoActivity
  def on_create(bundle)
    super
    self.content_view =
  end
end
[/sourcecode]

<p>Did you do it? Super!</p>

<p>Now the first thing we need to do is import the Linear Layout widget like so:</p>

[sourcecode language="ruby"]require &#39;ruboto/widget&#39;

ruboto_import_widgets :LinearLayout

class NewDemoActivity
  def on_create(bundle)
    super
    self.content_view =
  end
end
[/sourcecode]

<p>Now that it&#39;s imported we can use it. But hold on just a second, if you don&#39;t 
know what a layout is don&#39;t stress. It&#39;s just a container for the other widgets.
(What&#39;s a widget? Don&#39;t feel dumb, a widget is a general term for things like buttons
edit boxes, text boxes etc). A linear layout will either stack the widgets on top of 
each other (<code>orientation: vertical</code>) or it will have them flow side by side (<code>orientation:
horizontal</code>). </p>

<p>OK, so let&#39;s just stick a blank one in there and go on from here:</p>

[sourcecode language="ruby"]require &#39;ruboto/widget&#39;

ruboto_import_widgets :LinearLayout

class NewDemoActivity
  def on_create(bundle)
    super
    self.content_view = 
      linear_layout orientation: :horizontal do
        # The widgets, they go here
      end

  end
end
[/sourcecode]

<h2>Add a Text Field</h2>

<p>So for our first widget, let&#39;s just do a simple happy little text field. Again
the first step is importing the text field widget called <code>EditText</code>:</p>

[sourcecode language="ruby"]require &#39;ruboto/widget&#39;

ruboto_import_widgets :LinearLayout, :EditText

class NewDemoActivity
  def on_create(bundle)
    super
    self.content_view = 
      linear_layout orientation: :horizontal do
        edit_text
      end

  end
end
[/sourcecode]

<p>Ta da. You did it! Now you have a working app. Go ahead and try it out!</p>

<p>(If you don&#39;t know how to try it out, go back and re-read &#39;Running Your Application&#39;
super important)</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that the box starts out small and gets bigger as you type stuff in. Lets
make this thing a bit prettier by stating what its width should be ahead of time. The 
easiest way to do that is via the <code>weight</code> option.</p>

[sourcecode language="ruby"]require &#39;ruboto/widget&#39;

ruboto_import_widgets :LinearLayout, :EditText

class NewDemoActivity
  def on_create(bundle)
    super
    self.content_view = 
      linear_layout orientation: :horizontal do
        edit_text layout: {weight: 1.0}
      end

  end
end
[/sourcecode]

<p>Hey nifty. We&#39;ll play with weight at the end to get a better idea of what it does
but for now, just think of it as something that assigns a weight to the widget. So
if I have two widgets each of weight 1 then they&#39;ll both get 50% of the screen. If
I have two objects of weight 1 and one object of weight 2 then that one will get 
1/2 the screen while the little weight 1s will get only 1/4 each.</p>

<p>Ok, the other thing making that thing look weird is that usually those things
don&#39;t start out blank. We call that text the &quot;hint&quot;:</p>

[sourcecode language="ruby"]require &#39;ruboto/widget&#39;

ruboto_import_widgets :LinearLayout, :EditText

class NewDemoActivity
  def on_create(bundle)
    super
    self.content_view = 
      linear_layout orientation: :horizontal do
        edit_text layout: {weight: 1.0}, hint: &quot;Enter Some Text!&quot;
      end

  end
end
[/sourcecode]

<p>If you&#39;re serious about learning this stuff from scratch, I highly highly recommend that you
run the app each time after you update a line of code. You&#39;ll get to see it in the flesh. Way
better than those wimpy screen shots.</p>

<p>Anyways, good job. Let&#39;s move on.</p>

<h2>Add a Button</h2>

<p>OK, as you might be able to guess. Adding a button is as easy as</p>

<ul>
<li>Import <code>:Button</code></li>
<li>then put <code>button</code> in the layout</li>
</ul>

[sourcecode language="ruby"]require &#39;ruboto/widget&#39;

ruboto_import_widgets :LinearLayout, :EditText, :Button

class NewDemoActivity
  def on_create(bundle)
    super
    self.content_view = 
      linear_layout orientation: :horizontal do
        edit_text layout: {weight: 1.0}, hint: &quot;Enter Some Text!&quot;
        button text: &quot;Send&quot;
      end

  end
end
[/sourcecode]

<p>And that&#39;s it. Crazy simple! Now let&#39;s start talking to the button!</p>
