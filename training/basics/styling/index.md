# Styling

This tutorial is the first departure from the android lessons at [android.com](http://developer.android.com/training/index.html).
I feel it necessary to create it because a major distinction between Ruboto and regular android
development is that in Ruboto we try to do everything programmatically which means
we don't do much with manifest files, xml, etc. That's great for the programmatic
aspects of your ruboto app but it means getting style things (like pictures, colors, etc.) to work we need a special skill set.

I do want to keep these lessons somewhat related to the android ones,
so in this lesson we'll keep working with our actionbar example, except now we'll edit the icon, background color and so much more!
